## Features

- Input any URI/URL and see its protocol, host, path, parameters, and fragment.
- Recursively decodes parameters that are themselves URIs/URLs.
- Visualizes each level with color-coded borders for clarity.
- Responsive, modern UI with semantic HTML.
- No backend requiredâ€”runs entirely in the browser.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Paste a URI/URL into the input field.
3. Click "Decode & Unpack" to see the structured breakdown below.
